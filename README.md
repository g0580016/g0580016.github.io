# Can AI and data actually help us build a more sustainable future?

The problems we’re facing—climate change, shrinking resources, and environmental damage—are huge. But there’s a silver lining: satellite data, coding, and AI give us tools to make real change. Pair that with creative, driven people tackling challenges on a global stage, and suddenly the impossible starts to feel possible.

The [**EY AI & Data Challenge**](https://challenge.ey.com) is a perfect example of this in action. Every year, students and early-career professionals from all over the world dive into real-world problems, applying coding, AI, and data science to make a difference. The challenge theme changes each year, but the goal is always the same: take data, turn it into insight, and build solutions that can actually scale beyond the competition.

Speaking from experience as a winner of a previous edition focused on rice crops, I can say this isn’t just about winning a prize. The challenge pushed me to level up my skills, tackle complex datasets, and collaborate with brilliant minds I wouldn’t have met otherwise. Honestly, it helped me carve out my own career path, giving me opportunities to work on projects I’m genuinely excited about. It’s interesting how a competition can shape your career path while still letting you geek out over data and AI.

The [**2026 EY AI & Data Challenge**](https://challenge.ey.com) is already in full swing, with participants from around the world registering and diving into real-world problems. This year, the focus is on optimizing clean water supply in Africa, where teams are building AI models to forecast water quality in South African rivers using satellite data, weather information, and on-the-ground environmental measurements. The solutions being developed won’t just help local communities—they could also serve as frameworks for other regions facing similar water challenges, while giving participants hands-on experience applying AI and data science to tackle pressing sustainability issues.

And here’s the cool part: the skills you gain don’t stop there. The talent coming out of these challenges becomes a force for change, ready to tackle sustainability problems wherever they appear.

At the end of the day, AI and data aren’t some magic key—but they are the tools that let us unlock new possibilities. Every model we build, every dataset we explore, opens the door just a little further. And with competitions like the EY AI & Data Challenge, we don’t just build solutions—we build skills, careers, and maybe even a better world.
